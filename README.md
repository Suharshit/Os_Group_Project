## Topic: User-friendly system call interface for enhanced security

Introduction:
This project demonstrates the fundamental file system operations—file creation, reading, writing, and deletion—using system calls in an operating system. We have developed a user-friendly UI interface using Python to interact with these file operations seamlessly. The project provides an intuitive way to understand how an operating system handles file management at the system level. By leveraging Python’s built-in functionalities, we simulate real-world file system interactions, making it easier to visualize and comprehend the working of system calls. This project serves as a practical learning tool for understanding file handling mechanisms in operating systems.
